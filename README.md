# Overview

I wrote this web app to become more fammiliar with node and working with different backend tools.

This web app is a simple blog. To run the server, you must type "npm run devStart" in the terminal. After that navigate to localhost:5000 on a web client and you will be able to acces the blog.

My goal for this web app was just to gain more experience with node and to try something I haven't tried before.

# Web Pages

There are 4 pages. The first page is the index/hime page. It dynamically displays the articles with the title, date created, description, and options to edit delete, or view. The second page is new/create page which uses the form feilds to take input from the user and saes them to the database. the third page is edit. This page takes the id from the article and places eveything back in the form feilds, making it so the user can edit them and send it back to the database. The final page is show, which brings up the article and all of the content with it.
